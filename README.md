The main notebook is `ADM-HW2.ipynb` which reads the module `functions.py`. The image `ERD.png` pictures the structure of the database we created for our analysis.

The shell scripts for the Command Line Question are `commandline_original.sh` and `commandline_LLM.sh`. For this execute the scripts from the same folder the `series.json` is stored!

The Python script which was uploaded to the AWS EC2 instance and executed from there is `awsq_script.py`.

**Note:** The notebook `ADM-HW2.ipynb` creates a local database `tables.db` (approximately 7GB) using the `SQLite3` package in the same folder as the notebook. If the file already exists only a connection to the database is being established.
